    "Write a simulation for a simple game of chance (e.g., drawing cards, rolling one or more dice, etc.) Run the simulation 1000 times and interpret the outcome. Post your code here, and discuss what might be done to improve it.\n",

    "I will create a simulation model for a fair coin flip. We will specify the number of flips and store the results for evaluation. We will simulate different number of flips on an incremental basis and conclude on any observable trend.\n"
